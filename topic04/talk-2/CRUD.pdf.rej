-CRUD analysis ties data modeling to business functions. Although functional modeling is not covered in this
-course, the business functions and processes that the client describes will operate on the data. CRUD
-analysis checks that all the appropriate operations are possible. This is a good tool to check for
-completeness and proper scope of the data model.
